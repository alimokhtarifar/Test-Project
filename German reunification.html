    <h1>German reunification</h1>
    <p>
      The East German government dominated by the Socialist Unity Party of
      Germany (SED) (a communist party) started to falter on 2 May 1989, when
      the removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria opened a hole in the
      Iron Curtain. The border was still closely guarded, but the Pan-European
      Picnic and the indecisive reaction of the rulers of the Eastern Bloc set
      in motion an irreversible movement.[2][3] It allowed an exodus of
      thousands of East Germans fleeing to West Germany via Hungary. The
      Peaceful Revolution, a part of the international Revolutions of 1989
      including a series of protests by the East German citizens, led to the
      fall of Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 and GDR's first free elections
      later on 18 March 1990 and then to the negotiations between the two
      countries that culminated in a Unification Treaty.[1] Other negotiations
      between the two Germanies and the four occupying powers in Germany
      produced the so-called "Two Plus Four Treaty" (Treaty on the Final
      Settlement with Respect to Germany), granting on 15 March 1991 full
      sovereignty to a reunified German state, whose two parts were previously
      bound by a number of limitations stemming from their post-World War II
      status as occupation zones, though only on 31 August 1994 did the last
      Russian occupation troops (Russia is the successor of the Soviet Union
      legally) leave Germany.
